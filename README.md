Hi, I’m Diego.

I’m a B.S. Applied Mathematics graduate from NC State with interests in
data science, machine learning, and data engineering.

I enjoy working on applied projects involving real data, especially
time series forecasting, streaming pipelines, and sports analytics.

I’ve built projects using Python, SQL, Kafka, Spark, and common ML tools,
focusing on end-to-end systems rather than isolated models.
